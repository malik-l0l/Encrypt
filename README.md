# 🔒 Encrypt 🔑

Welcome to the world of covert communication! Get ready to dive into a thrilling adventure where messages are encoded using a unique encryption system that's sure to keep your secrets safe. With this terminal encryption system, you can send coded messages with a twist that's as fun as it is secure!

## 💡  The Idea

Picture this: an encryption system that flips the alphabet upside down, turning 'a' into 'z', 'b' into 'y', and so on. It's like speaking in a secret code where every letter has a hidden meaning known only to those in the know. Use this encryption system to send coded messages to your friends and family—it's like having your own secret language!

## 💁🏻 Example

Let's say your message is "cat." Using the encryption system, "c" becomes "x," "a" becomes "z," and "t" becomes "g." So, "cat" becomes "xzg"—a coded message ready to be sent to your fellow secret agents!

## 🛠️ Main Technologies

- `Python 3.x`
  - `time`
  
## 🚦 Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment,Python must be installed on your system and follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or just copy-paste the code in `encrypt.py`.
2. Run `pip install tkinter` in the project directory to install the Tkinter library, which is usually included with Python installations.
3. Run `py encrypt.py` in terminal or click on run `▶️` button to get the project started.

## 📙 How to Use

1. **✍🏻 Input Your Message:** Start by entering your message into the terminal. Whether it's a simple greeting or a top-secret mission briefing, type it in and get ready to see the magic unfold.

2. **⏳ Encryption Process:** Watch in awe as your message is transformed right before your eyes. Each letter is replaced with its encrypted counterpart, creating a coded message that's impossible to decipher without the key.

3. **🗝️ Decryptor Included:** But wait, there's more! Not only can you encrypt messages, but you can also decrypt them using the same system. It's like having your very own decoder ring to unravel the mysteries of encrypted messages.

## 🐛 Current Bug

So far, I'm not really sure if there are any bugs. However, there might be some issues. I tested it out on my computer (Windows 10), and so far it looks good there.
